-- Assessment Q4: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation
-- Objective: Estimate each customerâ€™s CLV based on their transaction volume and tenure.

USE adashi_staging;

-- Step-by-step:
-- 1. Compute total transactions and total confirmed amount (in Naira)
-- 2. Compute average transaction value
-- 3. Derive avg profit per transaction (0.1%)
-- 4. Use CLV formula: (total_tx / tenure) * 12 * avg_profit_per_tx
